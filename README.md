# MisMatch App
An App widely accessible for storing and sharing information about buildings/offices/schools/marketplace etc which would be very helpful to persons with disabilities.

## About This Project
Development of a centralized platform with web-based portal and a mobile app for storing and sharing of information about accessible buildings/ public places/ offices. The system will also store their physical locations so that the information can also be shown on a on-screen map. The system will store and share information about the accessibility features viz. provisions of ramps, handrails, accessible toilets, Braille signage, accessible counters, lifts, wheelchairs etc. The system will store and share photographs and videos of such places. After a disabled person chooses a building/ location he/ she wants to travel using this system, the app guides him/her with suitable voice-based announcements (along with showing directions on the dynamic map) to navigate and reach the place.

## Working of Our App

We used, Flutter to provide the most user friendly experience to our mobile  app users with integrated maps fetched using Mapbox API to provide the most accurate and abundant search results.
